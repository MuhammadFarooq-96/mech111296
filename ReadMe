# Prerequisites
Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following:

Python 3.8 or higher installed (visit the official python page)
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed (you can install by running this on your cmd: pip install jupyterlab)
An active internet connection for package installations


# Environment Setup
To set up the environment and run the main_eda.ipynb file, follow the steps below:

Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

# code:
# Create a virtual environment named 'eda-env'
python -m venv eda-env

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
eda-env\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source eda-env/bin/activate


# Step 2: Install Required Dependencies
After setting up the environment, install the necessary Python libraries required for running the notebook. You can install them manually or use the provided requirements.txt.

# Option 1: Install using requirements.txt (if provided)
pip install -r requirements.txt


# Option 2: Manually Install Required Libraries
If requirements.txt is fails to sail through, install the dependencies manually:

for example:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn pyspark

# Step 3: Download the Dataset
Ensure the dataset used in the analysis is available in the correct directory. Place it locally in the same folder as main_eda.ipynb.


# Step 4: Launch Jupyter Notebook
After the environment setup, launch Jupyter Notebook and open the main_eda.ipynb file:

# step 5: Start Jupyter Notebook as follows:
- open command prompt (cmd) 
- Navigate to directory where main_eda.ipynb file is located
- type the command: jupyter notebook
- the file will open in your default browser and you will be able to run the cells sequentially in the main_eda.ipynb file
